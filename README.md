# Queue using Linked List in C++

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Queue** data structure using a **singly linked list** in C++.
The queue supports basic operations such as enqueue, dequeue,print, view front/rear elements, search for values, count elements, and clear the queue.

## 📌 Features

- Enqueue (`EnQueue`) — Insert an element at the end.
- Dequeue (`DeQueue`) — Remove an element from the front.
- Check if the queue is empty.
- Get the front and rear elements.
- Count the number of elements.
- Search for an element.
- Print the entire queue.
- Clear the queue from memory (destructor-safe).

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

- Each node stores an integer value and a pointer to the next node.
- The queue maintains two pointers:
  - `front` — points to the first node (head).
  - `rear` — points to the last node (tail).
- Memory is managed manually using `new` and `delete`.
